<!-- ## Welcome  -->

## Welcome 

I am currently an AI scientist at Uniphore Software Systems working on conversational data building the latest Natural Processing models as per the organisations needs. Before joining, I had worked on Dialogue System as a research scholar in Human-Computer-Interaction department of Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad (IIITA), India under [Prof. U.S. Tiwary](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Uma_Shanker_Tiwary) and  also a member of [SILP](https://silp.iiita.ac.in/) (Speech, Image and Language Processing) Lab. 

My research area and interest lies in:

1) Dialogue state tracking in MultiDomain language. 

2) Use of Fuzzy set in 'Natural Language Understanding' of dialogue systems.

3) Development of robust conversational agent for specific domain.
   
4) Analyzing the word vector and searching for a better intermediate representation in language understanding phase of Dialogue System.

5) Deep Learning Model in Natural language Understanding (like Transformers Model,LLMs, RNN,LSTM,CNN)

6) Generative AI and Prompt Engineering

7) Development of Ontologies and their applications

8) Information Retrieval

<!--  I'm working on conversational AI in production and research at [PolyAI](https://www.polyai.com/). I am passionate about everything that is related to applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I did my PhD in [Dialogue Systems Group](http://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/people/) at Cambridge University working on long-term conversational agents jointly supervised by [prof. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and [prof. Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/). I also had a chance to work with [prof. Milica Gašić](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html).

Prior to that, I was working on training deep belief networks using high-temperature expansion being supervised by [prof. Rich Turner](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and advised by [Nilesh Tripuraneni](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nileshtrip/). For my bachelor, I graduated in mathematics from [Adam Mickiewicz University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz_University_in_Pozna%C5%84).

If you have any questions feel free to contact me - my mail is pfb30 at cam.ac.uk.

**NEWS**:

The slides from the Conversational AI tutorial at EMNLP'19 are [here](https://www.polyai.com/emnlp19/).

I recently gave a couple of talks about recent progress in learning multi-domain dialogues with MultiWOZ including Apple, Facebook and Stanford. See also a new challenge in [DSTC8](https://sites.google.com/dstc.community/dstc8/home) based on MultiWOZ.

Our paper with the largest multi-domain task-oriented dataset publicly available has won the best resource paper award at EMNLP! [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00278) [[code]](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz) [[data]](http://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/corpus/)

We won the best student paper award at ICASSP 2018 for working on uncertainty estimates in DeepRL! [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11486), [[code]](https://pydial.org) -->
